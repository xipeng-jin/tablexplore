Introduction
------------

This application is intended for educational/scientific use and allows quick
visualization of data with convenient plotting. The primary goal is to let users
explore their tables interactively without any prior programming knowledge and
make interesting plots as they do this.

One advantage is the ability to load and work with relatively large tables
as compared to spreadsheets. The focus is on data manipulation rather than
data entry. Though basic cell editing and row/column changes are supported.
The program is free and open source. It is based on a Qt (PySide2) widget called
pandasqtable which itself is a graphical frontend to the pandas DataFrame class.

Installation
------------

For all operating systems with Python and pip installed:

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/dmnfarrell/tablexplore.git#egg=tablexplore

Linux

The pip method above should work fine for most distributions but if you prefer
you can also try the AppImage (experimental).
Download from the latest release page and run as follows:

    chmod +x tablexplore-0.3.0-x86_64.AppImage
    ./tablexplore-0.3.0-x86_64.AppImage

There is also a snap available, which can be installed using:

    snap install tablexplore

Windows

A Windows standalone binary can be downloaded
